### Session: Nuxt with extended markdown
- [Repo](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/winter-2022)
- Goal: Test `markdownit` install
- where's the documentation?
- Nice! Ash linked to [the documentation](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/blob/main/doc/plugins.md#list-of-plugins) in `nuxt.config.js`.
- Search: `remark vs markdown-it`
    - featured: [Super nerdy critique in favour of remark](https://github.com/benrbray/noteworthy/discussions/16)
    - `remark` looks pretty cool
    - damn, it doesn't look like there's a way to add classes?
    - never mind! It's all about [`remark-directive`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive) (for now, until all the new plugins are ported to remark version whatever)
- Anyway, back onto testing definition lists.
- can't seem to get it to work. Going to try adding `remark-directive` to see if I can narrow this down.
- `remark-directive` doesn't work either. I think it's time to give up for the night and ask Ash. Maybe a pair coding session?

    - R+D: `git stash`
